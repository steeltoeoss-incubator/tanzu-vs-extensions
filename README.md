# tanzu-vs-extensions

## Introduction

The `TanzuForVS` project provides a VSIX extension that allows Visual Studio users to interact with Cloud Foundry from their IDE.

The `CloudFoundryApiClient` project is a dependency of the `TanzuForVS` extension; we are currently adding functionality to it on an as-needed basis. For a more complete api client (many endpoints, but targeting V2 of the CF api), see [cf-dotnet-sdk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/cf-dotnet-sdk).

As of October 2020 we are still working on an MVP & are not yet advertising this tool publicly.

## Contributing

GitHub issues & pull requests are welcome! Please recognize that we are a small team with a limited capacity to engage heavily with open source contributions, so the best way to get new feature requests implemented is by contributing code.
